A online dating website where single people could make friends here: https://www.onlinedatingapp.online/

Users will signup using Email address. For initial signed in, Admin will send welcome message for new users, which is an automatic message built with socket.io. 

Users can find singles in the `singles` page, where they can send smile, add friends, and chat with each other. When chatting, the private chat room will be created and I will charge users for each message they send and accept payment from clients using Stripe Checkout.

Users can upload pictures for profile, and share posts with images, which are stored in AWS S3. Others can leave comments and thumb up for each public post that users share.

Website will be mobile friendly and responsive. If you open website from any mobile device, it will automatically adjust screen size based on device.
